Grocery Shop Management System
Welcome to the Grocery Shop Management System repository! This Java application facilitates efficient management of a grocery store's inventory and customer transactions. Built using JDBC and MySQL, the system allows customers to interactively purchase items such as rice, dhall, and ghee, with real-time updates to inventory quantities and automated generation of invoices. Employees can manage stock levels and view current inventory status through a user-friendly console interface. This project aims to demonstrate effective use of object-oriented programming principles in Java for building scalable and maintainable software solutions in the retail domain.
